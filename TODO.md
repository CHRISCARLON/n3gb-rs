Prep v0.1.7

Allow a user to pass in a polygon and create a grid area from that.

Tidy up the API as hex_csv takes in path and ouputs to file where as the parquet_hex outputs to parquet based on arrow batch - not as consistent as I'd like.

Bring more in line with methods used in the H3 Rust implementation.
